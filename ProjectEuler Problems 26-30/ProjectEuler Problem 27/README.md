<h1> ProjectEuler 27: Quadratic Primes</h1>
<p>Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:</p>
<center>n<sup>2</sup> + n + 41</center>
<p>It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values 0 &le; n &le; 39.<br>
However, when n = 40,
<center>40<sup>2</sup> + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41</center> is divisible by 41.<br>
And certainly when n = 41,<br>
<center>41<sup>2</sup> + 41 + 41</center>
is clearly divisible by 41.</p>
<p>The incredible formula n<sup>2</sup> - 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values 0 &le; n &le; 79. The product of the coefficients, -79 and 1601, is -126479.</p>
<p>Considering quadratics of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
n<sup>2</sup> + an + b, where |a| &lt; 1000 and |b| &le; 1000<br><br><div>where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n<br>e.g. |11| = 11 and |-4| = 4</div>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.</p>
