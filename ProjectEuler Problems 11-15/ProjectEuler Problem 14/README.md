<h1>ProjectEuler Problem 14: Longest Collatz Sequence</h1>

<p>The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">

<p>n &rarr; n/2 (n is even)</p>
<p>n &rarr; 3n + 1 (n is odd)</p></ul>

<p>Using the rule above and starting with <b>13</b>, we generate the following sequence:</p>
<center> 13 &rarr; 40 &rarr; 20 &rarr; 10 &rarr; 5 &rarr; 16 &rarr; 8 &rarr; 4 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 1. </center>
<p>It can be seen that this sequence (starting at <b>13</b> and finishing at <b>1</b>) contains <b>10</b> terms. 
Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at <b>1</b>.</p>
<p>Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?</p>
<p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.</p>
