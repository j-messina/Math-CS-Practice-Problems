# Math/CS Practice Problems via ProjectEuler.net
<p>This is a collection of my solutions to practice problems from ProjectEuler.net, which provides a myriad of math/computer science problems.</p>

<p>Each folder represents the corresponding problem from the ProjectEuler website, with solutions implemented in one or more languages. </p>

<p>As of June 2023, my aim is to implement solutions for each problem in at least Python, C++, and Java.</p>
